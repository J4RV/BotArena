BotArena is a programming game. 
The objective is to program a robot AI; you will code what the robot will do every turn, and what the robot will do when certain events happen (like hitting a wall).

Your robot will battle against other robots, programmed by other players or by yourself. For every round where your robot is the last robot alive, you will get 100 points.
